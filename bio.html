<h1>Bio</h1>

<p> Ethan hails from sunny Phoenix, Arizona. An avid hiker from a young age, Ethan became an Eagle Scout when he was only 14 years old.</p><p> Ethan quickly found his passion for acting when his beloved poetry teacher ushered him into the school production of Pride and Prejudice and has since acted in more than a dozen productions.</p><p> It was this very passion that led Ethan to Computer Science. On the brink of dropping out of college in favor of bussing tables and auditioning in La La Land, Ethan decided to shake up his classes for his possibly-last semester. Upon the suggestion of his older brother, a professional Software Engineer, Ethan added Intro to Computer Science. Discovering a hunger and pleasure for coding, Ethan decided not to leave college but to pursue a degree in Computer Science.</p><p>Ethan still loves to act but has come to terms with a multifaceted character profile, including even at times sacrificing one passion for the other. </p>
